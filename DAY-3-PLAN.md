- [ ] Test scalability with increasing fleet size

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications

### Docker Environment
- **Base OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **ROS Version**: ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- **Python**: 3.10 with ML packages
- **Build System**: colcon
- **Simulation**: Gazebo Classic + Ignition

### Development Workflow
1. **Open in VS Code**: Use Dev Containers extension
2. **Auto-setup**: Container builds with all dependencies
3. **Instant Development**: Full ROS 2 environment ready
4. **Port Forwarding**: Web interfaces accessible from host

- `8080`: Web server/dashboard
- `8888`: Jupyter notebooks for RL development  
- `11311`: ROS Master (legacy support)
- `11345`: ROS Bridge for web integration

## 📈 Success Metrics

- [x] Container builds successfully (< 15 minutes)
- [x] ROS 2 commands work out of the box
- [x] VS Code extensions load properly
- [x] Port forwarding works for web interfaces
- [ ] Multi-robot simulation launches correctly
- [ ] RL training pipeline integrates with ROS 2
- [ ] Real-time fleet coordination demonstrations
