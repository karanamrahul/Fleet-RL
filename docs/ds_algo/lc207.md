# LC 207: Course Schedule

## Problem Statement
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. 

You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Solution Approach: Cycle Detection in Directed Graph

### Key Insights:
1. **Graph Representation**: Prerequisites form a directed graph
2. **Cycle = Impossible**: If there's a cycle, some courses depend on each other
3. **3-Color DFS**: White (unvisited), Gray (processing), Black (done)

### Algorithm:
1. Build adjacency list from prerequisites: `prerequisite → course`
2. Use 3-color DFS for cycle detection:
   - **White (0)**: Unvisited node
   - **Gray (1)**: Currently being processed (in DFS path)
   - **Black (2)**: Completely processed
3. If we encounter a **Gray** node during DFS → **Cycle detected** → return `false`
4. If no cycles found → return `true`

### Implementation:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        // Build adjacency list
        vector<vector<int>> graph(numCourses);
        for (auto& prereq : prerequisites) {
            int course = prereq[0];
            int prerequisite = prereq[1];
            graph[prerequisite].push_back(course);
        }
        
        // 3-color DFS
        vector<int> color(numCourses, 0);
        
        function<bool(int)> hasCycle = [&](int node) -> bool {
            if (color[node] == 1) return true;  // Gray = cycle
            if (color[node] == 2) return false; // Black = done
            
            color[node] = 1; // Mark as processing (Gray)
            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                if (hasCycle(neighbor)) return true;
            }
            color[node] = 2; // Mark as done (Black)
            return false;
        };
        
        // Check all nodes for cycles
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (color[i] == 0 && hasCycle(i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V = courses, E = prerequisites
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for color array and recursion stack

## Test Cases
1. **Simple valid**: `[1,0]` → can finish (no cycle)
2. **Simple cycle**: `[1,0],[0,1]` → cannot finish (cycle: 0↔1)
3. **Complex valid**: Multiple dependencies without cycles
4. **No prerequisites**: Always possible
5. **3-node cycle**: `[1,0],[2,1],[0,2]` → cycle: 0→1→2→0

## Key Learning
Course scheduling is cycle detection in a directed graph. The 3-color DFS approach efficiently detects back edges which indicate cycles in the dependency graph. 
prerequisites 

pre[a,b] = i should take b first in order to take a



so i think we need to find out cycles ( if found then it is impossible)


so the graph should be acyclic and should't have any cycles

so unique elements should be available 

so we basically traverse through the graph and add to visited.

if we ever find it again i.e cycle then we
