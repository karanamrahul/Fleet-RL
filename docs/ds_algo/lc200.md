## Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Solution Approach: DFS on 2D Grid

### Key Insights:
1. **Connected Components**: Each island is a connected component of '1's
2. **Mark Visited**: Turn land ('1') into water ('0') to avoid double counting
3. **4-Directional DFS**: Check up, down, left, right neighbors

### Algorithm:
1. Iterate through every cell in the grid
2. When we find '1' (land):
   - Increment island counter
   - Use DFS to "sink" the entire island (mark all connected '1's as '0')
3. DFS explores all 4 directions and marks visited cells
4. Return total island count

### Implementation:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        const int rows = grid.size();
        const int cols = grid[0].size();
        int islands = 0;
        
        auto dfs = [&](auto&& self, int r, int c) -> void {
            // Boundary check and water check
            if (r < 0 || r >= rows || c < 0 || c >= cols || grid[r][c] == '0')
                return;
            
            grid[r][c] = '0'; // Mark as visited (sink the land)
            
            // Explore 4 directions
            self(self, r - 1, c); // Up
            self(self, r + 1, c); // Down
            self(self, r, c - 1); // Left
            self(self, r, c + 1); // Right
        };
        
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == '1') {
                    islands++;
                    dfs(dfs, r, c); // Sink the entire island
                }
            }
        }
        
        return islands;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m × n) - visit each cell once
- **Space Complexity**: O(m × n) - recursion stack in worst case

## Test Cases
1. **Single large island**: Tests DFS traversal
2. **Multiple separate islands**: Tests counting logic
3. **No islands**: Edge case with all water
4. **Single cell island**: Minimal island case

## Key Learning
Island counting is finding connected components in a 2D grid using DFS with 4-directional movement and in-place marking of visited cells.


1 - land
0 - water

ret no.of.islands

island - all the edges are surrounded by water


idea:

traverse throught the graph and counter to count the number of islands

so we loop the matrix we increment the counter everytime we break the loop 

like in the second example 

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]


s1-  we see 1 we add it to out hash_map see all the edges (if we even see one land then we move to the next varible do the same  and if the variable is 0 we continue if we see a new one after continue then we increment the counter

does it make sense


DFS or BFS


)


Output: 3


first create visited matrix and then
